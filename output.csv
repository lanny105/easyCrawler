Our focus is to celebrate and promote Japanese animation, comics, and pop-culture.

This event has been a cornerstone of the North East Anime Convention circuit since our inaugural event in April, 2003. Following unprecedented growth, we quickly outgrew the space in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and moved to the Hynes Convention Center in 2005. The Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston have allowed us to grow in ways we could not have imagined since the idea was first conceived.

While the main focus on Anime Boston has always been Japanese animation and comics, we have expanded to include other aspects of Japanese pop-culture: J-Pop, J-Rock, and live-action Japanese media. We have also delved into Japanese history and traditional culture, thus encouraging people to develop a more well-rounded perspective.",Anime

Welcome to an official AnimeCon.org convention! Expect a jam-packed 3-day convention filled with cosplay, vendors, artists, anime screenings, panels, dealers, tutorials, lessons, workshops, voice acting, guests, autographs, video gaming, tabletop gaming, karaoke, and so much more.

== Cool Stuff ==
ConSweet - Filled with unlimited free ramen and rice for all attendees, plus free soda! We're working on making this bigger and better this year, so that you can have a more and more fun convention on less and less money!
Video Gaming - An epic game room with your favorite games, and tournaments held all weekend long, some with special prizes.
Karaoke - Sing your heart out with your fellow fans and discover a cool way to make friends even if you're not the best singer.
Anime Screenings - An Anime Convention should remember the anime, and we make sure to! In our video room you can see everything from new shows to old favorites, and it's a great way to pass the time between panels (oh, wait, there usually isn't any time between panels).
Special Guests - Our guests range from voice actors to musicians and beyond, and they bring you inside knowledge from the world of anime and Japanese culture (and sometimes even video gaming and sci-fi).

== How To Attend == 
Get your tickets on our website, and the earlier you get them, the cheaper they are. Most attendees register in advance to save time at the door, but you can also get your tickets at the convention. We highly encourage early registration to get the best deal and get in faster!

== Events and Schedule ==
The schedule will be posted on the website about 3-4 weeks prior to the convention. The schedule includes exact panel, workshop, Q&A session, and autograph session times, as well as the times for video game tournaments and tabletop tournaments, and more.

== Who We Are ==
AnimeCon.org's mission is to bring fun and awesome experiences to our fellow anime fans and nerds around the country. We've run 20+ conventions ourselves, and our staff have worked countless others. Learn more at www.animecon.org",Anime

Le Comiccon de Montréal est un événement destiné aux amateurs de culture populaire à l’occasion duquel ces derniers ont la chance de rencontrer des artistes et de voir un large éventail de produits issus de l’univers du divertissement : science-fiction, horreur, anime, jeux vidéo sous toutes leurs formes et, bien sûr, bandes dessinées et comic books. On y trouve une grande diversité d’exposants, notamment des entreprises qui y présentent leurs marchandises, ainsi que des véhicules ou d’autres éléments marquants de films ou de séries télévisées. Il s’agit d’une occasion unique pour les collectionneurs de trouver le tee-shirt, le comic book, le jouet, la figurine, le DVD ou Blu-ray ou la réplique dont ils rêvent. 
 
Les aficionados de comic books et de bandes dessinées ont quant à eux la chance de rencontrer leurs artistes préférés, de demander leur autographe, d’acheter un dessin ou de les remercier pour leur travail. L’un des points marquants de l’événement est certes la possibilité pour les visiteurs de rencontrer les artisans mêmes de leur émission de télé ou de leur film préféré. Les vedettes participent à des séances de photo et de signature d’autographes, et donnent des conférences accueillant de 700 à 2 500 personnes.

On encourage les visiteurs (sans les obliger, toutefois) à se costumer sous les traits de leur icône de la culture populaire préférée (cinéma, télé, jeu vidéo ou comic book, par exemple). Le défilé de costumes atteint son apogée lors de la mascarade, grand concours de costumes présidé par des juges venus des quatre coins du monde qui notent plus de 60 concurrents devant les encouragements de près de 2 500 amateurs réunis pour l’occasion.
 
Pendant les trois jours de l’événement, les visiteurs sont invités à plus de 100 groupes de discussion et ateliers visant la promotion des comic books, des costumes, des jeux vidéo et de la culture populaire en général. Une zone de jeux vidéo est aménagée pour ceux et celles qui voudraient découvrir des jeux en démonstration, participer à des tournois ou simplement profiter d’une séance de jeu gratuite. Les démonstrations sur place et les tournois de jeux vidéo de sport englobent à la fois des jeux indépendants et des titres parmi les plus prisés. Dans l’ensemble des longs et courts métrages présentés, notons des films d’amateurs ainsi que des productions indépendantes et de grands studios.

It is produced and promoted by Imaginarium LLC (the team behind the Tampa Bay Comic Con and Indiana Comic Con), which is an event production and advertising agency comprised entirely of people that have a true love for comic books, stories, artwork and pop-culture. The people of San Francisco deserve a comic convention of their very own, and the San Francisco Comic Con is San Francisco’s very own.

Featured are exhibitors that cater to a wide-spectrum of interests including comic books, magazines, toys, games, Star Wars, Star Trek, anime, manga, cosplay, artwork, sketches and apparel. In addition, a roster of comic industry professionals and comicdom-related celebrities are in attendance for attendees to meet and greet. As always, children 12 and under are admitted for FREE, helping to instill the San Francisco Comic Con as the premier family-friendly comic convention in the region.",Comic
