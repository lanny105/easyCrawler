We contacted The Make-It-Fit Foundation out of Columbus Ohio and explained how we wanted to help. They put us in contact with Autism Rocks out of Cincinnati, Ohio and it was agreed that a percentage of profits raised will be split between the two organizations to send kids with autism to the Surfers for Autism events each year.

This three-day event provides fans of various geekdoms the opportunity to gather and enjoy their interests as a whole. Panels and workshops, as well as many artists, vendors, and tabletop/LARP games, can be found in great abundance throughout the weekend. And of course, we have a fabulous array of guests who will be attending and presenting panels. 

What sets ConBust apart from most other sci-fi, fantasy, anime, and/or gaming conventions is its focus on the female members of the participating community. While the various realms of geekdom remain stereotypically male-dominated, ConBust is held to celebrate the work and participation of women amongst these genres."
