The image of the red serpent that appears in the first and last episode of the series brings Spartacusâ€™ rebellion full circle, as it is the physical manifestation of his wifeâ€™s prophecy that he is destined for great and unfortunate things. Our mission is to host a convention that demonstrates the fighting techniques of various ancient cultures, and to display artistic creations and interpretations in the areas of leathering, armor making, paintings, drawings, comic books and more. We aim to please the fans by hosting the biggest, most exciting Rebels convention ever! Complete with cosplayers, artists, exhibits, celebrity guests, Stuntmen and Stunt Coordinators, Crossfit trainers and Legion instructors! Our goal is to spread our interest of historical activities and ancient fighters who redefined how battle strategies are implemented today. We intend to instruct, encourage, and support a healthy lifestyle by focusing on food nutrition, exercise, and strength training. We plan to achieve these goals through means of annual conventions hosted in various cities throughout the United States. If you are a fan of television and films, such as Spartacus, 300, Vikings or Xena, if you enjoy reading books about ancient cultures such as Rome, and Greece, or if you love live action role-playing (LARPing), SpartaCon is the event for you!",Comic,http://www.upcomingcons.com/comic-conventions
